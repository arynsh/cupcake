    <h2 class="flashy">History of us</h2>
    <p>We are Daniel and Sharon! We live in the gorgeous city of Seattle with
    our three amazing kitties. We started baking cupcakes for our friends and
    family as a hobby but when they realized how amazing our cupcakes were, we
    became inundated with requests for custom cupcakes! This was when we
    realized that we could possibly make this hobby a full-time job! We're
    ecstatic that people love our cupcakes as much as we do!!</p>

    <h2 class="flashy">Pop on over to our shop!</h2>
    <p>We are located in the heart of leafy, green Seattle, WA! </p>
